The Synapse AI Nodebot is a chatbot designed to connect to OpenAI's ChatGPT via an API connection.  It is written in Javascript, HTML and CSS, and I have a similar product 
  written in Python as well.  This repo/folder showcases my ability to build a complete product which was targeted to municipalities to improve their town websites.
  This product is a 24/7 customer service solution for town constituents looking for answers from their local government regarding issues such at trash pickup days, etc.
