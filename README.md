# Machine Learning Projects
Multiple techniques of machine learning.  Under Python/Machine Learning folders.  My favorites are multi-linear regression and NLP, which specifically derive insights from multi-dimensional data and text review data respectively.  


# Web Scraping Projects
Under the Python folder, please see the Selenium Folder for "NBA Scores and Line Scraper.py".  This file showcases my use of XPaths to scrape live NBA score and time data into Pandas dataframes, and combines them with live score line bet amounts from RISportsBet.com.  Ultimately predicting a score and a bet amount based on a projected score window.

  Thank you!

# AI Projects

Under the Synapse AI Nodebot folder is a functional product I developed to upgrade municipal websites as a custom embedible ChatGPT, trained on their respective town/city
  data.  For example if I wanted to lookup my trash pickup day at my specific address, Nodebot would respond accurately based on the training data fed to OpenAIs API.
