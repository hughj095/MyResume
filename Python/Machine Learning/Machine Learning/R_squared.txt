# The residual sum of squares is the ordinary least squared value which builds the regression model line

R**2 = 1 - (residual sum of squares/total sum of squares)

Therefore R**2 the closer it is to 1, the more accurate the model

1 is a perfect fit
0.9 is a very good model
0.7 is not great
0.4 is terrible

Adjusted R Squared accounts for new independent variables
