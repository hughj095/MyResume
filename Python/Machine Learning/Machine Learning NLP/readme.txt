Natural Language Processing

Deep Learning and Neural Networks are related to NLP by DNLP (Deep NLP).

Seq2Seq, sequence to sequence, is a subset of DNLP, and is the hottest topic within DNLP as of 2023.

Classical vs DNLP.  
Classical uses If/Else rules (Chatbot), Audio-frequency component analysis (Speech recognition)
    Bag of Words model (Clasification), 

DNLP could use CNN for text recognition (Clasification)

Logistic Regression can also be used to determine a Yes/No answer to an NLP input (voice text). One example is Positive or Negative reviews of a restaraunt

A voice text vector could also be fed through a neural network. This is DNLP.
