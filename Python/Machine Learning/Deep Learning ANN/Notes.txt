# An ANN is an attempt to simulate the network of neurons that make up a human brain so that the computer 
#   will be able to learn things and make decisions in a humanlike manner.  Each "neuron" in an ANN takes 
#   an input value, makes a caluculation with an Activation Function, back-propogates to adjust a weight value for future calculations,
#   and finally produces an output value.

# Activation Functions in the Neuron:
  # Threshold Function - outputs a 1 or 0 (yes or no)
  # Sigmoid Function - Probability between 0 and 1.  Used in Logistic Regression. USed in the Output Layer often. 
  # Rectifier Function - most popular, 0 then increases at a slope.  Used in the Hidden Layer often.
  # Hyperbolic Tangent - Probability between -1 and 1.

# The purpose is to minimize the Cost function value.  AKA Back-Propogation.

# Gradient Discent is necessary to calculate the lowest Cost function because there are too many combinations
#  of dimensions for even the fastest super-computer to handle.  Gradient Discent finds the y value when the slope 
#  is zero (which is the lowest cost value).

# Stochastic Gradient Disscent adjusts the weights row by row for each record, while regulrr Gradient Disscent 
#  adjusts the weights after all records and field are inputted and calcuations are made.  It is much more volitile 
#  than regular Gradient Disscent and much more likely to find the global minimum.  It is also much faster to calculate.

# Back-propogation 

# Step 1: randomize the initials weights (close to zero, but not zero)
# Step 2: Dataset is input into the input layer, one field/record per input node
# Step 3: The weights affect the input values, and the activation formulas preduct the first y 
 # values
# Step 4: Compare the predicted result to the actual training data result
# Step 5: Back-propogation and update the weights using the Cost function
# Step 6: Repeat steps 1-5, update the weights after each observation (Reinforcement Learning),
    # or update the weights after a batch of observations (Batch Learning)
