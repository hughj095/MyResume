SOMs - Self Organizing Maps

Many imputs through a matrix of weights, outputting a 2D output.
It organizes data clusters into 2D groups, based on many inputs.
Example, ranking quality of living by country, based on health score, education score, inflation, etc.

SOMs are different such that the weights are a characteristic of the node itself.  There are no activation functions.
  It uses the Eucledian distance to find which node is closest to the input values.
  Then the weights of the node are updated.

SOMs retain the topology and integrity of the data and nodes in relation to each other.
SOMs reveal correlations that we do not expect.
SOMs classify data without supervision.
SOMs don't require a target vector or back-propogation

SOMs organize themselves based on similar features of each output value, thus grouping like items together
